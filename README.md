### Traffic-Data:
- **length** = Total length (in meters)
- **olr** = TPEG OpenLR encoded as Base 64 strings
- **shape** = series of geo-coordinate describing the shape of the roadway
- **speed** = The average speed (in meters per second), capped by the speed limit, that current traffic is travelling
- **speedUncapped** = The average speed (in meters per second), not capped by the speed limit, that current traffic is travelling
- **freeFlow** = The free flow speed (in meters per second) is a reference speed provided to indicate the speed on the segment at which vehicles should be considered to be able to travel without impediment
- **jamFactor** = The number between 0.0 and 10.0 indicating the expected quality of travel. When there is a road closure, the jamFactor will be 10.0. As the value approaches 10.0 the quality of travel is getting worse
- **confidence** = The number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the proportion of real time data included in the speed calculation.
